"""Loader for a suite campaign under results/suite-<id>/<chip>/.

WHY A SEPARATE MODULE. common.py's load()/cell() encode the OLD corpus's directory and filename
conventions (results/<gpu>/onpair_summary_<dataset>.json, dataset ids like tpch-sf10 and lship).
A suite leg lands somewhere else entirely, with the clock state in the filename and fifteen
columns whose ids do not overlap the old ten. Teaching common.py both shapes would put a branch
in every existing figure; this keeps the new layout in one place and leaves those figures alone.

MISSING DATA IS REPORTED, NOT HIDDEN. A campaign is often partial -- a leg still running, a chip
that stocked out, a stage that skipped. Every accessor here returns None or an empty result for
absent data rather than raising, and `coverage()` says exactly what is present. Figures are
expected to draw the hole with a fixed legend, so a reader sees that the A100 is missing instead
of seeing a plot that silently has three chips in it.

DEFINITIONS, matched to figures/tab_datasets.py so a number means the same thing everywhere:

  tokens  gpu.distinct_codes
  len     sample_bytes / (gpu.compressed_bytes / 2)   token-weighted mean decoded bytes per code.
          NOT gpu.dict_mean_len, which is the unweighted mean over dictionary ENTRIES and runs
          about 25% higher.
  le8     gpu.frac_le8
  ratio   sample_bytes / on_disk_bytes -- AT REST: string bytes in against the stored .vortex
          file, which holds the bit-packed codes, the dictionary and the offset sidecar.
          CORRECTED 2026-08-22. This read gpu.compressed_bytes, which is the in-memory UNPACK
          (exactly 2.0001 B per code, 12-bit codes widened to u16), so it understated OnPair-12
          by 17-33% and overstated OnPair-16 by up to 12%. See ratio() for the measurements.
          The prior docstring rejected mem_ratio as "the flattering one" and kept the unpack.
          That was backwards: mem_ratio's denominator is within 0.001% of on_disk_bytes, so the
          number it rejected (FineWeb2 1.99) is the correct at-rest ratio and the one it kept
          (1.49) divides by an array that only exists after decode begins.
  rate    decoded_bytes / min(decode_ns_iters) for the SHIPPED selector (gpu.auto_kernel), in
          GB/s. bytes/ns is exactly GB/s. min-of-N per Lemire, matching every prior campaign.

# ============================================================================================
# "EXPERIMENTAL" DOES NOT MEAN "IGNORE THIS". READ THIS BEFORE CHOOSING A RATE.
# ============================================================================================
# Every kernel the grid generator emits carries role: KernelRole::Experimental. That is a
# BUILD-SYSTEM DEFAULT -- gen_packed_grid.py stamps it on line 126 of every variant it writes --
# and it is not a judgement about validity, correctness or deployability. All 564 generated
# kernels (the dg, dw, dh and ds families) are byte-validated on every leg exactly like the
# production ones, and they are the entire evidence base for Section 4.
#
# The 20 kernels marked production are the older hand-written set (onpair_decompress_1tpt..8tpt,
# onpair_shmem_*). They expose K, and they do NOT expose T, B or S. So gpu.best_kernel and
# gpu.best_decode_gib_s, which range over production only, are the best rate reachable through
# the CURRENT SELECTOR -- not the best rate the codec achieves. On Wikipedia at OnPair-12 the
# difference is 916 against 985 GB/s, 7.5%, and the winner is onpair_ds_k6_t128_b4_s14.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS FOR A COMPARISON. We hand every baseline its own parameter sweep and then
# quote its best: the Decompression Engine gets four codec families crossed with five chunk
# sizes and we report best_codec AND best_chunk_bytes; nvCOMP Zstd gets three levels; a
# dictionary codec gets its dictionary size. Varying K, T, B and S is the SAME KIND of tuning --
# a compile-time configuration of one decoder, chosen per column -- and excluding it while
# including theirs is not conservatism, it is an asymmetric handicap that understates this work
# against baselines we tuned freely.
#
# So: pick the basis deliberately and say which one, per figure.
#   - "best deployable"   -> production only. Honest for "what a user gets today", and it is
#                            what gpu.best_kernel gives you.
#   - "best configured"   -> max over all timed kernels. The right basis against a baseline
#                            whose own best configuration is being quoted.
# Neither is wrong. Silently taking best_kernel because it is the field that exists, while the
# other side of the plot gets its full sweep, IS wrong.
#
# There is a standing caution in this repo against quoting the fastest probe as "the codec's
# rate". It is worth knowing what it does and does not rest on: the two retractions in the
# paper's history are the 1.7x port-versus-GSST claim (cd70a94, our port got pre-staged offsets
# outside the timed region while GSST paid for positioning inside its own) and a revert of wrong
# DE corrections (064c8dc). Neither concerned quoting our own best probe. Treat the caution as a
# prompt to name the basis, not as a reason to discard 564 measurements.

    THE DENOMINATOR IS THE .vortex FILE, not gpu.compressed_bytes. Corrected 2026-08-22 after
    the field names misled an earlier version of this file. Measured on the B300, ClickBench URL
    at OnPair-12:

        on_disk_bytes         346,042,804   the file: bit-packed codes + dictionary + sidecar
        in_memory_bytes       346,039,324   the same arrays, less ~3.5 KB of file framing
        gpu.compressed_bytes  426,552,691   exactly 2.0001 B per code -- the in-memory UNPACK

    gpu.compressed_bytes widens 12-bit codes to u16 for the decode path, so dividing by it
    understated OnPair-12 by 17-33% (exactly 4/3 where codes dominate: 1.5 B at rest against
    2 B read) and overstated OnPair-16 by up to 12%, since it excludes the dictionary and
    sidecar that on_disk_bytes includes. A compression ratio is about data at rest.

    This matters beyond the table: fig_perf_real's dominance test puts these points against
    Zstd's raw_bytes/compressed_bytes and the DE's best_ratio, both of which ARE stored ratios.
    Using the unpack here compared us against baselines on a denominator we alone paid.

        CONTAINER-MATCHED WHERE THE CODEC AND ITS CONTAINER DIFFER. FSST-12 stores codes in its own
    fixed 12-bit packing, while OnPair's go through the same integer compressor as the rest of the
    Vortex array, which bit-packs to about log2(cardinality). Dividing by each technique's own
    stored size therefore compares FSST-12's CONTAINER against OnPair's CODEC: on a column with
    five distinct values it charged FSST-12 twelve bits per code and OnPair three. The cells carry
    mem_ratio_container_matched for exactly this, measured through OnPair's instrument, and no
    figure read it -- the decision was taken on 2026-08-12, applied to the ten-column generator,
    and lost when the fifteen-column one replaced it with this codec-agnostic helper. Effect on the
    real columns is 0-10%; on TPC-H l_shipinstruct it is 3.37x to 11.37x.

    CHARGED AT THE GRANULARITY OF THE KERNEL BEING REPORTED, when the caller passes one. The
    sidecar holds one offset per batch of 32*K codes, so its size follows the K its reader was
    compiled for; charging a fixed 192 while reporting the best kernel over all K pairs a
    throughput with a stored representation that kernel does not read. Pass
    kernel_tok_per_batch(c, basis) matching whichever rate you plot. `tok_per_batch=None` keeps
    the shipped 192, which is right for a table that pairs the ratio with no rate at all.

    FSST-12 STAYS AT 192 and that is a scope limit, not an oversight. Its sidecar is measured on
    the cell rather than by granularity, and re-deriving it needs a re-encode from parquet, whose
    trained dictionary is platform-dependent. Thirteen of its fifteen B300 best kernels are at 192
    already; the other two are COARSER, so their true sidecar is smaller than charged and the
    reported ratio is conservative by at most the sidecar's whole share, which is under 1.1%.

    THE SIDECAR IS IN THE DENOMINATOR, on both dictionary codecs. It is storage a reader must have
    to position a batch's output without a serial scan over everything before it, so by the rule in
    docs/notes/2026-08-27-stored-size-accounting.md it counts. The byte-oriented baselines have no
    equivalent because their decode is serial, and charging ourselves for it is the honest way to
    state that trade -- Section 3 prices the alternative, regenerating it on the device, at 14 to
    19% slower. It is 0.26 to 0.72% of OnPair's stored column and 0.00 to 1.05% of FSST-12's, and
    changes no ordering.
