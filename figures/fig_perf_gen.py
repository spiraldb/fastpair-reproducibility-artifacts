"""Fig. perf_gen: decode rate per column across devices AND across SM clock.

The companion to fig_perf_real, which fixes the device and varies the codec. This varies the
device and the clock, and shows one kernel family covering the whole matrix.

LAYOUT. One slot per column. Inside a slot, one short VERTICAL LINE per GPU, packed side by side.
Each line carries that GPU's decode rate at every clock state it was measured at, so the line's
extent IS the clock sensitivity of that chip on that column. Four horizontal BARS across the slot
are the B300 Decompression Engine's four codecs, each at its own best chunk size.

DRAWN AT ITS PRINTED SIZE. This is a two-column float landing at about seven inches, so figsize
matches that. An earlier version was drawn ten inches wide and scaled down on the page, which
shrank every label by a third and made the figure unreadable in print.

ENCODING. Colour is the GPU, grouped by MEMORY TECHNOLOGY: the three HBM parts take a blue ramp
and the GDDR6 L40S green. That is the axis that separates these chips for this kernel, and it also
keeps every chip clear of the orange the DE bar uses. Marker shape is the CLOCK STATE, and it is
assigned by nominal state (boost, max, 75%, 55%, 40%) rather than by absolute MHz, because the
same nominal state lands on different frequencies per part -- 1905 MHz on the B300 is 'max', so is
1830 on the H100 and 2520 on the L40S. Shape therefore means the same experimental condition on
every chip, which is what the reader needs to compare.

WHY THE CLOCK ARM IS HERE AND NOT ITS OWN FIGURE. It is the falsification, not a curiosity: with
the memory clock pinned, decode rate that scales with the SM clock rules out DRAM bandwidth, DRAM
latency, and an L2 request-rate bound, because l1tex runs at the SM clock while L2 and DRAM are
separate domains. It does NOT separate L1 request rate from compute, issue, register file or
shared memory, and this figure does not claim it does.

BEST AGAINST BEST, PER CODEC. Each DE bar is one codec at its best chunk size; our marks are the
best kernel. Both sides tuned, neither handicapped. Collapsing the engine to a single best-of-four
bar named one codec in the legend and hid the other three, so the reader could not see that most
of the engine's spread on these columns is the codec choice rather than the chunk size. Four bars
is not the twenty-configuration cloud an early draft drew: the chunk sweep is still reduced away,
only the codec axis survives.

MISSING CHIPS KEEP THEIR SLOT AND THEIR LEGEND ENTRY. A leg that has not landed leaves a labelled
gap, so a reader sees three chips and a hole rather than assuming three was the design.

# HBM parts take the blue ramp, the GDDR6 part green. Memory technology is the axis that
# actually separates these chips for this kernel, and keeping the non-HBM part out of the blues
# also keeps every chip clear of the orange the DE bars use.
# GDDR7 joins the GREEN family, not the blues, and takes the dark rung so the GDDR pair reads as a
# ramp exactly like the HBM triple does. That keeps the figure's encoding honest: colour family is
# memory technology, lightness is position within it. It also matters for what this chip is FOR --
# RTX PRO 6000 is Blackwell silicon behind GDDR7, so it sits beside the B300 in architecture and
# opposite it in memory, and a reader must be able to see which of those the colour tracks.
# From common's device family, which is ordered HBM-then-GDDR so scale position carries the
# memory-technology grouping this figure encodes.
# Layout order is the paper-wide one, filtered to the chips whose legs landed.
