"""Fig. percycle: what decode rate scales with across GPU generations.

THE ARGUMENT. If decode were limited by how many bytes a device can deliver, its rate would
track memory bandwidth. It does not. Normalising instead by the SM-cycle budget a device has --
streaming multiprocessors times boost clock -- makes the rate nearly constant across three
generations, which says the scarce resource is SM-side work per byte and not bytes.

Left panel, per device: decoded bytes per SM-cycle that FastPair achieves, against the HBM bytes
per SM-cycle the memory system could supply. The achieved bars sit at a near-constant height on
the HBM parts while the available bars vary by more than 2.5x, and the gap between them is the
headroom the decoder never uses.

Right panel: the same claim as a scaling test. From the A100 to the B300, decode rises about 2.3x
while peak memory bandwidth rises 5.1x and the SM-cycle budget rises 2.0x. Decode follows the
SM-cycle line, not the bandwidth line.

WHY THIS AND NOT A ROOFLINE. An earlier version argued the same point from a sector-rate roofline
built on profiler captures. That model reproduced the ordering within an architecture but missed
the absolute level by an undetermined per-architecture constant (1.22, 1.22, 1.82 on
a100/h100/b300), which is not a clock ratio and which we could not decompose. This construction
needs no profiler, no fitted constant and no derived peak: committed decode rates, published SM
counts and clocks, vendor-rated bandwidth.

THE L40S IS EXPLAINED, NOT EXCLUDED. It supplies 2.4 bytes per SM-cycle, BELOW the 3.4 to 4.0 the
decoder consumes on every HBM part, so it is the one device where the byte term is the binding one
and it lands at 1.22. That is the quantitative version of the boundary the length relation and the
SM-clock sweep both find, and it is the reason it appears here rather than being dropped as an
outlier.

RATE IS THE MEDIAN over the ten real columns at OnPair-12, per device, so no single column's
character sets the comparison. The generated five are excluded as everywhere else.

each leg's own device_properties.json; bandwidth is the vendor rating in tab:arch.
