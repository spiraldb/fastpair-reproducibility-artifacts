"""Fig. tokendist: the rank-frequency curve of every column's dictionary reads.

WHY A DISTRIBUTION AND NOT A STATISTIC. An earlier version of this material summarised each
column to one number, the entropy of its code-reference distribution over the maximum. That
number does not separate the groups: at OnPair-12 the generated columns span 0.79 to 1.00 and the
real ones 0.55 to 0.93, and Loghub Windows, a real column, reads lower than either of the two
generated columns the codec inverts. A summary that overlaps cannot carry the claim, so this
draws the shape it was computed from and lets the reader see whether the groups differ.

WHAT ONE PANEL IS. Every distinct code the column uses, sorted by how often it is referenced,
descending, on a log frequency axis. A uniform distribution is a flat line; a Zipfian one falls
away. Panels are independent: each autoscales to its own column, because the columns differ by
four orders of magnitude in both code count and reference count, and a shared axis would flatten
every panel but the largest into a line.

NO SHARED SCALE MEANS NO CROSS-PANEL MAGNITUDE CLAIM. The comparison this figure supports is of
SHAPE. A reader cannot read "more references" off it, and nothing in the paper asks them to.

Source: results/token-freqdist-corpus/<column>.op12.txt, one count per line, sorted descending,
emitted by encodings/onpair-sys/examples/onpair_skew.rs under FREQ_OUT. OnPair-12 only: at twenty
panels this size three overlaid curves are not legible, and the codec changes how far the tail
runs rather than the shape of its head.

    THE FIFTEEN CORPUS COLUMNS COME FROM suite.py, like every other figure in this directory,

    a second derivation of them. Value bytes is sample_bytes/rows and codes per value is that

    The five short real columns are not in the campaign suite -- they were never benchmarked,
