"""Fig. perf_real: the result space on ONE device as throughput vs compression ratio.

Every mark is a B300 measurement from one suite leg. Holding the device fixed is the point: an
earlier form drew our codec spanning four GPUs while the Blackwell-only DE and nvCOMP codecs were
single B300 points, which set our four-generation spread against each baseline's best chip and
understated the same-device margin the prose claims. Varying the device is fig_perf_gen's job.

This deliberately reuses fig_sota's look -- theme, palette, family shapes, log axes, expanded
legend, panel proportions -- because it IS fig_sota rebuilt on the fifteen-column corpus. The
styling is not re-derived here; where they differ, fig_sota is right.

BEST AGAINST BEST, AND EVERY CONFIGURATION OF THEIRS. Our mark is the best kernel. A baseline
gets its whole sweep -- the engine's four codecs crossed with five chunk sizes, three Zstd
levels, three nvCOMP software codecs -- reduced per column to the configurations nothing else of
that baseline beats on both axes. Tuning only one side would be the sandbag, and quoting only
the engine's fastest setting would have hidden its high-ratio half, which is the interesting
one. Per-column shipped-selector rates, what a deployment gets, are reported in the prose.

THE STAIRCASE IS THE BASELINE PARETO FRONTIER, and the claim is asserted PER COLUMN. A codec's
ratio is a property of the data, so a pooled frontier can put us on one column against a baseline
on another; with c_address in the corpus that produces false violations. Like for like, 26
baseline configurations per column: 30 of 30 real-column marks clear all of them, and the
generated panel has exactly one exception, pinned by name in main().

ZSTD IS A REAL COMPETITOR ON LOG-STRUCTURED COLUMNS, not the floor-dwelling series it first looks
like. Its GPU rate tracks the FRAME COUNT a column yields, not the codec: Loghub Windows gives
2022 frames and decodes at 165-200 GB/s with a 25-50x ratio, while Wikipedia's long documents give
115 frames and 1.7-3.1 GB/s. It is therefore in the per-column dominance test, not just the plot.

gANS AND BOTH BITCOMP VARIANTS COME FROM A SECOND LEG. The paper suite's DE stage runs only
DEFLATE, LZ4 and Snappy, so these three are measured by the MATERIALIZE+SW leg
(results/suite-baselines-*) and merged here. The two legs share a vortex_rev, a training seed, the
fifteen columns and raw_bytes per column, which is what makes one axis legitimate; see
suite.baselines_root(). None of the three reaches our compression ratio on any real column, so
they sit left of every OnPair mark rather than under it -- Bitcomp-sparse is the fastest thing on
the panel on four of the ten, and stores 1.00 to 1.10x while doing it. The one place a software
codec dominates us is gANS on c_address, generated random characters where a pair-merging
dictionary has nothing to merge and an entropy coder still has a character distribution.

    no single setting has, and the level is the one Zstd knob a user actually sets.

    EACH FRONTIER IS THE WHOLE SWEEP: every frame measured at that level, staircased into the best
    rate the level reaches at each ratio or better. Not the pruned set the faded marks once drew,

    HATCHED, NOT FILLED. A solid fill covered the baseline envelope with a shape identical to it
    wherever Zstd was the only baseline left, so the envelope appeared to stop at a ratio it does
    not stop at. Hatch marks the area and the envelope reads straight through.

    DISJOINT BANDS. Three hatched regions layered over each other cross into noise exactly where
    the levels overlap, which on the real columns is nearly everywhere. So at each ratio the
    levels are ordered by what they reach and each one hatches only the slice between its own

    reader lands in names the most restrictive level that gets there.

    POOLED ACROSS THE PANEL'S COLUMNS, like the envelope around it and for the same reason: it is
