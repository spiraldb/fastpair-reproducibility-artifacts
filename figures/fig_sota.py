"""Fig. sota: the result space on ONE device as throughput vs compression ratio.

Every mark is a B300 measurement. This is deliberate and it is the fix for the previous
form, which drew FastPair and Zstd as boxes spanning four GPUs (A100->B300) while the
Blackwell-only DE and nvCOMP codecs were single B300 points: that compared our four-
generation spread against each baseline's best chip, so the visual understated the
same-device margin the prose claims (a ~1.5x apparent gap where the B300-vs-B300 number
is 2.2x on ClickBench URL). Varying the device is now fig_crossarch's job; this figure
varies the codec and holds the device fixed.

The staircase is the BASELINE Pareto frontier: at each compression ratio, the best decode
rate any non-FastPair baseline achieves at that ratio or better. The paper's claim is
positional, that no baseline decodes faster than FastPair at an equal or better ratio on
the same device, so drawing the frontier makes the claim visible rather than something the
reader must reconstruct from a cloud. FastPair marks above and right of the staircase are
the claim. main() asserts it and prints any violation.

Zstd levels that are Pareto-dominated by another level on the SAME column are omitted:
they sit strictly below-left of a kept point, so they cannot affect the frontier or the
claim, and the three levels cost 30 marks. Throughput is LOG: FastPair (TB/s) and
software Zstd (sub-GB/s) span ~4 orders. Two panels (real | synthetic) share the
throughput axis; the synthetic columns reach far higher ratios, so the x-axes differ.
