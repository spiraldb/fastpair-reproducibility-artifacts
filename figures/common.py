# PALETTE BY ROLE.  One place; every figure asks for a colour by what the thing
# IS, never by hex.  Changing a scale is one edit here instead of a sweep of the
# generators, which is the whole point of this section existing.
#
# Two scales, chosen by what the figure is about:
#   "technique"  our codecs, and the devices they run on  -> viridis
#   "baseline"   the fixed-function Engine we measure against -> inferno
#   "analysis"   instrument readings and mechanism        -> plasma
# So a reader can tell at a glance whether a figure is showing WHAT SOMETHING IS or
# HOW IT BEHAVES, and the two never share a hue vocabulary.
#
# VIRIDIS IS CAPPED AT 0.90. Above that it runs into a saturated yellow-green: #d8e219 sits at
# luminance 0.691 with saturation 0.89 and only 1.42:1 contrast against the page, which is what
# reads as harsh. Plasma does not have the same problem at the same position, because it reaches
# its yellow only at the very top of its range, above anything sampled here. The cap is only
# affordable because the Engine moved to its own scale and freed viridis's middle.
#
# Both are perceptually uniform, which is necessary but NOT sufficient for a
# black-and-white printer: uniformity buys monotone luminance, so two members far
# apart in the scale survive greyscale and two members close together do not.
# greyscale_report() measures that instead of assuming it, and any family it flags
# has to carry identity in marker shape or hatch as well as hue.

# THE PAPER-WIDE DEVICE ORDER. Every figure that lays devices out side by side uses this, so a
# reader who learns the order once can carry it between figures. Before this existed there were
# four orders in the tree: suite.CHIPS_CORE, fig_pipes.ORDER, fig_crossarch.ORDER and the device
# palette family, all different.
#
# The rule is: memory technology first, newest first within each group.
#   - HBM before GDDR, because the boundary between them is what section 5.4 argues, so the
#     grouping has to survive being read left to right.
#   - Newest first inside a group puts the B300 -- the headline device -- at the left edge where
#     a reader starts, and walks backward to the A100, which is the direction the "reaches back
#     to Ampere" claim is made in.

# family -> (ordered members, scale, (lo, hi) span, mode). The span trims the ends of the
# colormap: plasma runs near-black at 0.0 and near-yellow at 1.0, and both lose
# contrast, one against ink and one against paper.
#
# mode picks how the members are placed inside the span:
#   "luminance"  equal steps in BRIGHTNESS, which maximises what a greyscale printer has
#                to resolve. Use for families whose members are categories.
#   "interior"   n evenly spaced positions with both ends dropped, i.e. member i sits at
#                (i+1)/(n+1) of the span. Predictable and symmetric; use for small ORDINAL
#                families where the reader reads the ramp as an order, not as identities.
#
# WHICH MODE A FAMILY TAKES IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. The interior form reads better as a ramp
# and is right for an ORDER, but it cannot be forced onto a categorical family: measured on the
# four-member pipe family it lands at a worst greyscale gap of 0.082 and RAISING the spread makes
# it worse, not better (0.084 at 1.8, 0.078 at 2.0, 0.064 at 2.4), because clamping pins the
# outer two members at the span's ends while the inner two stay in viridis's flattest luminance
# region. Categories therefore take "luminance", which clears the same family at 0.149.
#
# An interior family may carry a fifth element, SPREAD, which pushes the members outward
# from the centre of the span by that factor: 1.0 leaves the ends-dropped positions alone,
# 1.5 moves them half a step further apart. Raise it when three colours sit too close to
# tell apart at line width; positions are clamped to the span, so it cannot run off the
# end of the scale and back into the extremes the span exists to avoid.
