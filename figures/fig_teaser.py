"""Fig. teaser: the page-1 hook. B300 decode throughput for the three techniques the
paper decodes (OnPair-16, OnPair-12, FSST-12) against the alternatives a reader would
otherwise reach for: the fixed-function Decompression Engine at its best codec, and
software nvCOMP-Zstd at both ends of its level range.

Linear y-axis. The Zstd bars on Wikipedia (1-2 GB/s) are therefore near-invisible
against OnPair's ~870; their printed values carry the number.

THREE REAL COLUMNS. The previous form put TPC-H l_comment on page one, which is generated data,
and the paper quarantines generated columns everywhere else precisely because they decode faster.
Leading with one undercut that discipline before the reader reached Section 5.

Source: results/suite-<id>/b300/{sweep,fsst12}_summary_*_boost.json and onpair_nvcomp_hw.json.
