# `h100-fsst12` — FSST-12 decoded by the shipped FastPair kernels

H100 SXM (sm_90), Nebius eu-north1, vortex rev `2d909147f` (branch `mp/fsst12-bench`).
Two harness runs, both at that rev, contribute to this directory:

- `h100-fsst12-ncu-20260812-211225` (2026-08-12) — the five HuggingFace text columns.
- `h100-fsst12-recover-20260813-234851` (2026-08-13) — ClickBench, TPC-H, synthetic URL.
  These cells were measured in the first run and lost before collection: that launcher named
  its result files explicitly, so datasets added to the job later were never copied off the
  box. The recover launcher globs instead. Timing only, no NCU capture.

FSST-12 normalized into FastPair's decode ABI on the host (dense 12-bit codes unpacked to
`u16`, 8-byte symbols widened to 16-byte cells, per-code length table supplied) and decoded
by the **unmodified** shipped kernels. `fsst12_summary_*.json` are the FSST-12 cells;
`onpair_ref_*.json` are OnPair cells measured in the **same run on the same box**, so the two
codecs are compared without crossing sends.

- 46 unique FSST-12 cells, all reporting `verified: true` (byte-exact against the CPU
  reference). `run_cell_fsst12` aborts a cell that fails validation rather than emitting a rate.
- **Two ratio fields.** `mem_ratio` is NATIVE: codes in FSST-12's own fixed 12-bit packing.
  `mem_ratio_container_matched` measures the code stream through the instrument OnPair's codes
  go through (BtrBlocks over a `u16` array). Use the container-matched figure for
  codec-vs-codec claims against OnPair-in-Vortex.
- **The two bases agree only where cardinality is high.** They are equal to two decimals on
  the high-cardinality text columns (`fineweb/text` and `wikipedia/text`, 1.84 and 1.83 on
  either basis), and the gap widens as cardinality falls, because BtrBlocks bitpacks below
  12 bits where FSST-12's packing is fixed: `l_shipinstruct` (4 distinct) is 3.38 native vs
  11.39 matched, `l_linestatus` (2 distinct) 0.50 vs 8.00, and at the degenerate end
  `fineweb/language` (1 distinct) 1.00 vs 905.51. Any summary bound on the divergence has to
  name the column set it covers.
- **Filenames are not scopes.** `run.py` writes one `summary.json` per invocation and the job
  snapshots it per dataset, so a file named for one dataset can contain cells for others. Key
  on each cell's own `dataset_id` / `column` / `bits` / `codec`.
- **One duplicated record, byte-identical.** `synthetic/url` appears in both
  `fsst12_summary_synthetic.json` and `fsst12_summary_lship.json`: `lship` does not resolve as
  a dataset alias in this job (its column lands under `tpch-sf10`), and the failed snapshot
  captured the preceding invocation's `summary.json`. The two records match field for field,
  and `common.py:cell()` returns the first match, so nothing double-counts — but a consumer
  that aggregates must key on `dataset_id`/`column`/`bits`/`codec` rather than count records.
  47 records, 46 unique cells.
- `codec` is `"fsst12"` or `"onpair"`. `figures/common.py:cell()` takes a `codec=` argument;
  records written before FSST-12 existed carry no `codec` key and default to OnPair.
