"""Re-derive the abstract's numbers and confirm the prose still prints them.

    uv run experiments/check_abstract.py [path/to/0_abstract.tex]

WHY THE ABSTRACT IS A SPECIAL CASE. Every other number the paper asserts can be a macro from
claims.tex, so drift fails at compile time. The abstract cannot: it is copied out of the .tex into
mail, slides and submission forms, and a macro pasted somewhere without a LaTeX engine renders as a
stray token. So its numbers are literals -- and literals are exactly what goes stale when a leg is
re-run. This closes that hole from outside the file.

WHAT IT CHECKS, and it is two things, because either alone is a hole. First, that each declared
value still re-derives from committed results. Second, that the literal still APPEARS in the
abstract body -- otherwise editing the prose and leaving the guard behind passes green while the
paper says something else. The guard block is comments at the END of the abstract file, after the
text, so it never travels with a copy-paste.

Declared as `% VERIFY <key> <literal>` lines. A key with no derivation here is a failure, not a
skip: an unrecognised key means the guard and this file have diverged, which is the state the guard
exists to prevent.
