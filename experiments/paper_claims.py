"""Re-derive every numeric claim in the paper's Sections 2, 3 and 4, and check it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Those sections' numbers were derived in ad-hoc sessions and then typed into
prose. That is exactly how the project's recurring defect happens: a number outlives the state it
was measured in, and nobody can tell which. This script recomputes each one from committed data,
writes them to results/paper-claims.json for the record, and with --check compares them against
what the paper currently asserts.

    uv run experiments/paper_claims.py            # derive + write results/paper-claims.json
    uv run experiments/paper_claims.py --check     # non-zero exit on any drift

DECLARED vs DERIVED. `DECLARED` below is what the paper says today, transcribed by hand and cited
to a section. Everything else is computed. A mismatch means either the prose is stale or the data
moved, and the script does not guess which -- it prints both and fails.

# What the paper asserts today. Keys are checked; `tol` is absolute unless it ends in '%'.
# DECLARED is now the SMALL residue: values the paper does not cite through a generated macro.
# Anything in TEX below needs no declaration -- the emitted file is the contract, and verify.sh
# fails if the committed file differs from a fresh derivation. That removes the failure codex
# found in pass 3: a declaration and a derivation sharing one bug cannot disagree, so checking
# them against each other proved nothing.
#
# Tolerance 0 everywhere: every value is already rounded to its reporting precision, so a
# nonzero tolerance spans whole display units and would hide a real regression rather than
# absorb floating-point noise.
# THREE ENTRIES REMOVED 2026-08-23, and why, so they are not restored as a fix:
#   occ.l40s_shared_limited (77), occ.h100_regs_limited (116), occ.a100_shared_limited (35)
# Section 3.1 states no per-chip limiter count -- it argues the feasibility rule B*M <= A
# qualitatively and cites only \claimOccConfigs and \claimOccExact, both generated. So these
# asserted numbers the paper does not make, which is not a check that can pass or fail
# meaningfully. They were also measured on the 480-configuration standalone probe (120 per chip)
# while the emitted macros already read the suite leg's 1560 (390 per chip), so on the current
# basis they read 306, 374 and 140. The counts are still derived below and land in
# results/paper-claims.json; promote them to TEX if a sentence ever needs them.

    WHY THIS IMPORTS figures/suite.py. That module already defines at-rest ratio, min-of-N rate
    and the three baseline point sets, and fig_perf_real asserts the dominance property from
    them. A second copy of those rules here is how the number in the prose and the number in the
    figure come to disagree, which has happened in this repository before. suite.py has no third-
    party dependencies, so importing it does not change this script's dependency set.

    THE TEST IS PER COLUMN, AND ON THE REAL COLUMNS. A codec's ratio is a property of the data,
    so comparing our mark on one column against a baseline measured on another is not a
    comparison. The generated five are pooled into no real-data claim anywhere in the paper, and
    they are where the single counterexample lives -- gANS beats OnPair-16 on c_address, random
    characters that a pair-merging dictionary cannot merge. It is derived and reported here

    campaign, so a freshly ingested leg was invisible: `--check` went green against stale data and
    read as confirmation of the run that had just finished. Never let that be silent again.

    ONLY A CAMPAIGN COUNTS AS UNREAD. The guard is about deriving Section 3-4 statistics from a
    stale campaign while a newer one sits unread, and those statistics come from the GRID stage
    over the fixed fifteen columns. A leg with no GRID cannot supply them, so it is not a
    candidate and naming it here would only force --allow-unconsumed -- a flag that then covers a
    genuinely unread campaign as collateral, which is the failure this guard exists to prevent.
    That covers the baseline leg (MATERIALIZE + SW) and any narrowed single-question leg, without
    either having to be special-cased by name."""
